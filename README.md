# Labyrinths
If you want to create a new maze, you must enter a single digit that will be the dimension of the square/maze. The maze is created using the Prima algorithm.
If you want to save the maze, you must specify the file to which the maze will be serialized.
If you want to load the maze, you must also specify the specific file that the program will unpack.
If you have created or loaded a maze, you can display it or solve it using the bfs algorithm,  the shortest path.
